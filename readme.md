# Modifications

You will need to change the marker file if you want to detect a different marker image. You can do this going to https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html and use your own custom image. Download the marker .patt file and replace it in assets folder. Use the new png file for detection.
